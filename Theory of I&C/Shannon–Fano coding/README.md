## $$\textcolor{yellow}{\text{Hello World}}$$
You just need to  open folder "dist" and run decoder or encoder.

## Encoder
Will encode your words, symbols or sentenses. It returns whole code and dictionary with pairs word-code.

## Decoder
Needs code without spaces and dict for it.
You can enter dict step by step: word, code for word, word, code, etc.
Or use ready dict. If u use 2nd var, u need to enter dict as python dictionary {'a':'001', 'h':'101'}.
